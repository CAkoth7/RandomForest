Dataset

The dataset used:  
**Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.pcap_ISCX.csv**  
Part of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset â€“ a widely used benchmark for intrusion detection tasks.

Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Train-test split  
- Baseline model training using **Random Forest**  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)  
- Handling **class imbalance** using `class_weight`  
- Feature importance visualization  
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
